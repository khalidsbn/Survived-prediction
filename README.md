# Survived-prediction


This is a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic based on various input features. The project uses a dataset of Titanic passengers that includes information such as the passenger's age, gender, class, and fare paid, as well as whether they survived the disaster or not.

The project consists of several steps:

**1- Data preparation:** The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to prepare it for machine learning algorithms.
**2- Model selection:** Different machine learning algorithms are tested and evaluated to find the best one for this specific problem.
**3- Model training and evaluation:** The best model is trained on the dataset and evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.
